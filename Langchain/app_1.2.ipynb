She also gave specific ratings: an \"impressive\" rating for one of her performances on DNA.com, while Rediff.com gave a higher rating saying she delivered a performance that stands above previous films. In another review by The Hindu, Samantha was praised for going further from her famous role and conveying character complexity well.\n",

Also, mention where she appears in other languages and the commercial success of her Telugu version.\n",

      "Samantha received several high-profile awards, reflecting her exceptional performance across various genres. She earned four Filmfare Awards South, one Filmfare OTT Award, two Andhra Pradesh State Nandi Awards, four South Indian International Movie Awards, and three CineMAA Awards. Her performances were well-received, with DNA.com rating her \"impressive\" for one of her roles and Rediff.com praising a performance that stands above previous films. She was also commended in reviews that highlighted her depth and emotional delivery, especially during school sequences. Additionally, in the Telugu version, Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu received positive reviews and commercial success. Notably, Samantha won the Best Actress award at the 60th Filmfare Awards South for her performances in Neethane En Ponvasantham and Eega, making her the second woman to achieve this honor since Revathi secured both awards in 1993.
